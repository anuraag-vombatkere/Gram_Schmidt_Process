Hi!

This repository contains Python code that implements the Gram-Schmidt process, a method in linear algebra used to convert a set of 
linearly independent vectors into an orthonormal basis. The project demonstrates step-by-step orthogonalisation and normalisation 
of vectors and can be used for educational purposes, numerical computations, or as a reference for related linear algebra algorithms.
